# Release v0.1.0

Released on 2025-10-26: This release adds a robust Coinbase Advanced adapter with enhanced detection for clients exposing fiat helpers, runtime logging for when enhanced helpers are used, additional unit tests for wrapper mapping and failover, a small DRY_RUN demo script to exercise the wrapper, and a CI workflow that separates unit tests from optional vendor-integration tests. See `CHANGELOG.md` for full details.
